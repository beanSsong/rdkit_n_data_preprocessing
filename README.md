- csv files with number 00 are the exercise data.

- python code files 01 - 07 are prepared for the rdkit exercise.

- matlab script files 08 - 16 are prepared for the data preprocessing. Please run them in order or change the data variables like 'data_iqr' or 'data_zscore' to proper variables.

- If you have error with the code/script files, please check the ' or " notation or rewrite them.

- file 07 is modified, and now you can get molecular fingerprints with rdkit.
